## Introduction to Deep Learning
<br>
<p align='justify'>
Deep learning is related to machine learning based on algorithms inspired by the brain's neural networks. Though it sounds almost like science fiction, it is an integral part of the rise in artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses data reprocessing driven by algorithms, but deep learning strives to mimic the human brain by clustering data to produce startlingly accurate predictions.

### Perceptron
<p align='justify'>
A machine-based algorithm used for supervised learning of various binary sorting tasks is called Perceptron. A perceptron model is also classified as one of the best and most specific types of Artificial Neural networks. Being a supervised learning algorithm of binary classifiers, we can also consider it a single-layer neural network with four main parameters: input values, weights and Bias, net sum, and an activation function.
