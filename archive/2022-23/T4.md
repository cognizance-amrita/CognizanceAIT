## Introduction to classification Algorithms

Classification is the process of recognizing, understanding, and grouping ideas and objects into preset categories or “sub-populations.” Using pre-categorized training datasets, machine learning programs use a variety of algorithms to classify future datasets into categories.

Classification algorithms in machine learning use input training data to predict the likelihood that subsequent data will fall into one of the predetermined categories. One of the most common uses of classification is filtering emails into “spam” or “non-spam.”
