# AI | Task 1
## Introduction to Kaggle and basic Libraries and Tools of AI üîß
Kaggle is a free ML/AI platform in which you can find datasets, code and participate in interesting ML competetions üèÜ . It has a cloud notebook system in which you can use the datasets online and code in the cloud ! (how cool is that ?! theres more..) and we are provided with 2 GPU and 2 TPU accelerators üòÑ ( _30 hrs/week_ üòê ) for accelerating Neural Network training !!!

You need to create an account and search for datasets in the sidebar.
There will be a search bar in the top the datasets section. You can search you dataset and click the "Create Notebook" button which will get you to your notebook where you can code stuff üíª.

**Question 1**

A Python library used for complex mathematical and statistical tasks and operations. It is one of the important libraries used in data preprocessing and ML/DL Algorithms. We can create from basic equations to some of the most complex Neural Network architectures using this. The first part of this task introduces you to the basics of Numpy.

You can use this command in your terminal to install Numpy

```
pip install numpy
```

<hr>

1. Create a single and multidimensional arrays using numpy and also create a array of numbers of a specified range.

2. Convert the above array to a 3 x 12 array.

3. Create a multidimentional square matrix and find the inverse of it. 

    ( _Use the the below formula to compute the inverse. <br>Use the inbuilt inverse command too to validate your results._ )

$$  inv(A) = {adj(A) \over{ |A| } }$$

4. Extract specific rows and columns using Slicing

5. Import data from files directly into ndarray using the loadtxt function.

<hr>

**Question 2**

This Sub-task focuses on Universal functions in Numpy.
arr = [3,4,-2,5,1,-5,25,-6,9]
arr1= [4,16,64,25]
Take any of the above arrays and perform the following:
1. arrange and reshape.
2. Perform Unary funcions.
    a) np.abs(array): To calculate absolute value of each value of the array.
    b) np.sqrt(array): To calculate square root of each value of the array.
    c) np.exp(array): To calculate exponential value of each element of the array.
    d) np.square(array): To calculate square of each value of the array.
    e) np.sin(array): To find the sine value of each data in the array.
    f) np.cos(array): To find the cos value of each data in the array.
    g) np.tan(array): To find the tan value of each data in the array.
    
<hr>
Given:
weight_players=[75, 68, 82, 87, 69]

height_players =[170, 165, 175, 180, 168]
<hr>

3. Find out mean of the weight of the players.
4. Find out sum of the height of the players.
5. Find out standard deviation of the weight of the players.
6. Find out standard deviation of the weight of the players.


**Question 3: Introduction to Pandas**

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

You can use this command in your terminal to install Pandas
```
pip install pandas
```

<hr>


1. Convert the following into a Series of elements:
    l = [10,20,30,40,50]
    d1  = {"a":10,"b":20,"c":30,"d":40,"e":50}

2. Add the Following Series.
    ***Series 1:***
    India         1
    Srilanka      2
    Bangladesh    3
    Russia        4
    England       5

    ***Series 2:***
    India         6
    Srilanka      7
    Bangladesh    8
    Russia        9
    England       10

3. Create dataframe of size 5,4 with Columns W to Z and Rows A to E. Use np.random() for generation the entries.

4. Write the data frame to excel file.

5.Using loc and iloc
      a)Use the dataframe and Access any one column and any one row of the dataframe.
      b)Access data with index values of row A ssing loc and iloc
      c) Print a subset of the data by selecting any two rows and columns using loc.
      d)Drop the first row of the table.
