Kaggle is a free ML/AI platform in which you can find datasets, code and participate in interesting ML competetions 🏆 . It has a cloud notebook system in which you can use the datasets online and code in the cloud ! (how cool is that ?! theres more..) and we are provided with 2 GPU and 2 TPU accelerators 😄 ( _30 hrs/week_ 😐 ) for accelerating Neural Network training !!!

You need to create an account and search for datasets in the sidebar.
There will be a search bar in the top the datasets section. You can search you dataset and click the "Create Notebook" button which will get you to your notebook where you can code stuff 💻.
